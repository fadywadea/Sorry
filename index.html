          As we mark a year together, I find myself reflecting on the amazing<br />
          journey we've shared. This past year with you has been nothing
          short<br />
          of incredible, filled with love, laughter, and countless moments
          that<br />
          I cherish deeply. You have brought so much joy and light into my
          life,<br />
          and my love for you continues to grow each day. I want you to know
          how<br />
          much you mean to me and how grateful I am for every moment we've
          spent<br />
          together. Your kindness, your smile, and the way you care for
          meâ€”all<br />
          of it makes me fall in love with you over and over again. I also
          want<br />
          to take this moment to apologize for any times I may have made you<br />
          feel upset or hurt. It was never my intention to cause you any
          pain,<br />
          and I am truly sorry for those moments. I promise to always strive
          to<br />
          be better, to learn from my mistakes, and to love you the way you<br />
          deserve. Thank you for being the amazing person you are and for
          loving<br />
          me. I am incredibly lucky to have you in my life, and I look
          forward<br />
          to many more beautiful years together.<br />
          With all my love,
        </p>
